Hiring Managers
SAP Asia Pte. Ltd.
Singapore
Dear Hiring Manager,
I am thrilled to apply for the student intern position at SAP AI Business Services Singapore. The prospect of contributing to SAP�s cutting-edge AI innovations and witnessing their tangible impact on businesses worldwide excites me immensely.
My passion for AI and its potential to transform industries drew me to SAP, a company renowned for its leadership in business software and commitment to pushing technological boundaries. The opportunity to develop novel machine learning models and see them implemented in real-world applications perfectly aligns with my career goals.
I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science, where I have developed a strong foundation in data science, machine learning, and software engineering. I have also interned at various companies during these past two years in data science roles which has provided me with hands-on experience in programming languages such as Python, and proficiency in machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras. Additionally, I have honed my skills in data analysis, statistical modelling, and developing data-driven solutions.
During my tenure as a data science intern at KPMG, I spearheaded two projects. The first project focused on campaign analytics using uplift modelling to target segments of customers who were most likely to respond positively to marketing interventions that enabled precise segmentation, ultimately driving a 75% increase in campaign revenue and a 78% reduction in marketing costs. The second project involved utilizing generative AI for supplier risk management which included integrating GenAI models for text and sentiment analysis of user queries to generate a supplier risk assessment report. During my tenure at Bosch, I worked on a project to detect stages of a Bosch kitchen appliances using RMS current time series data which involved feature extraction and a combined supervised and unsupervised machine learning approach. 
These experiences have ignited my enthusiasm for leveraging data science to solve complex problems and deliver tangible results. The internship at SAP AI Business Services offers the perfect platform to merge my academic background with real-world applications. The chance to work on both research and production projects, developing and deploying machine learning models, is precisely the kind of challenge I am eager to tackle.
Thank you for considering my application. I am enthusiastic about the possibility of contributing to SAP�s pioneering AI initiatives and am confident that my skills and experiences make me a strong fit for this role. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your team.
Sincerely,
Nitika Borkar
